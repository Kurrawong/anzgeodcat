= ANZGeoDCAT Mapping

== to schema.org

`https://linked.data.gov.au/def/anzgeodcat/sdo`

This is a mapping between elements of the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/anzgeodcat[ANZGeoDCAT] Profile and the https://schema.org[schema.org].

_Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond._

_As well as describing web page resources, schema.org is also used to for some cataloging tools, for example https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/[RO Crates]._

Our preferred mapping so far: https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org

* Logic about not forcing mappings to only schema.org elements since schema.org can be used with other models too might need to be included
